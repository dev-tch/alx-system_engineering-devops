--  On your primary MySQL server (web-01), create a new user for the replica server
-- The name of the new user should be replica_user, with the host name set to %, and can have whatever password youâ€™d like
-- replica_user must have the appropriate permissions to replicate your primary MySQL server.
-- holberton_user will need SELECT privileges on the mysql.user table in order to check that replica_user was created with the correct permissions.

CREATE USER 'replica_user'@'%' IDENTIFIED BY 'root';
GRANT REPLICATION SLAVE ON *.* TO 'replica_user'@'%';
GRANT SELECT ON mysql.user TO 'holberton_user'@'localhost';
